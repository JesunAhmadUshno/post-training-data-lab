# PUBLICITY: post-training-data-lab (P28)

Publicity log under the documentation and publishing standard,
Section 7. Every finished level produces its written fan-out set,
each piece graded on the 1,000-point publicity rubric (accuracy 300,
research 200, gap fit 200, clarity 150, reach format 150), ship line
900. Drafts are prepared by the loop. Actual social posting follows
the standing platform rules and gates. The loop itself never posts
to social.

Project state: v1.0, Learn, Build, and Deep done 2026-11-05,
31 checks passing in total (12 Learn, 8 Build, 10 Deep, plus the
scaffold smoke test). Level grades on record: Learn 8,700 of
10,000, Build 8,800 of 10,000, Deep 8,300 of 10,000. Every dataset
in this repo is synthetic, generated or hand listed by this
project and labelled synthetic in every file. No real data was
used, downloaded, or claimed, and no external benchmark items
were downloaded or claimed.

## Actions polish pack (2026-11-05)

Applied through a pull request on 2026-11-05, following the Actions
polish pack standard. The pack adds: CI on a Python 3.11 and 3.12
matrix with a ruff lint step (the pre-existing CI steps preserved:
scaffold smoke test and the Learn, Build, and Deep test files, now
run per level with their runners, following the proven pack
pattern), CodeQL scanning, Dependabot for pip and GitHub Actions,
a release workflow that attaches a source tarball named
post-training-data-lab-<tag>.tar.gz to v* tag releases, Labeler,
Greetings (snake_case inputs for actions/first-interaction@v3:
repo_token, issue_message, pr_message), Stale in comment-only mode
(days-before-close: -1, never closes), and a docs summary page at
docs/index.md for GitHub Pages. Ruff scope is recorded in
ruff.toml (E, F, I, line-length 120). Ruff fixes in this pull
request were style only: 77 initial errors (15 E402 sibling
imports fixed with noqa markers, 11 E401 and 15 I001 import
format fixed by ruff fix and import splitting, 13 E702 and 12
E701 one-line statements split with no change to any condition
or value, 8 E501 long lines wrapped with no change to any string
value, and 3 F401 unused test imports removed), with no change
to behaviour or to any imported name that is used. All three
results files stayed byte-identical across the runners, so no
results file changes in this pull request. requirements.txt
records the standard-library-only fact so Dependabot pip has a
manifest to watch.

| Channel | Outcome on 2026-11-05 |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Pages | Docs page added at docs/index.md in this pull request. Pages enablement and live build status are verified after merge and recorded in the batch ledger; no live claim is made in this file before that check. |
| PyPI publishing | Held: needs a PyPI token, a new credential. Jesun's tap only. Not set up. |
| Social channels (LinkedIn, X, Facebook, Instagram, Threads) | Held: no posts made. The loop never posts to social; Threads waits for Jesun's tap per post under the standing gates. |

Publicity grade for this polish pack log piece, on the 1,000
point rubric (accuracy 300, research 200, gap fit 200, clarity
150, reach format 150), ship line 900:

| Piece | Accuracy /300 | Research /200 | Gap fit /200 | Clarity /150 | Reach /150 | Total /1000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PUBLICITY.md polish pack section (2026-11-05) | 295 | 180 | 195 | 145 | 95 | 910 |

At or above the 900 ship line. Named deductions: research minus
20, because the pack is a standard applied across repos and this
section records its application rather than new research; reach
minus 55, because the docs page is copy in this pull request with
no live Pages claim yet, PyPI publishing is held, and no social
channel carries this piece by the standing gates; accuracy minus
5, gap fit minus 5, and clarity minus 5 for summary compression
of the full pack standard, which lives in the batch files.
